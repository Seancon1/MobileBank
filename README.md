# MobileBank

As part of my senior capstone project, I was tasked to create a mobile application experience that would mimic popular mobile banking applications.

This is the entire Android Studio Project. Source code can be found in <a href="https://github.com/Seancon1/MobileBank/tree/master/app/src/main/java/com/prestigecode/mobilebank">this</a> directory.
